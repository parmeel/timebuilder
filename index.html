							<h4 class="feature-title">Alarm Clock</h4>
							<p>We often have so many tasks, activities and events throughout our day that we lose track of time and don’t get everything accomplished. The best way people manage time is by setting constant reminders. Time Builder’s alarm clock feature allows the user to set alarms for activities that need to be completed throughout the day. The alarm clock feature allows the user to select a specific time and date and then label the alarm with a name. The user has the option to repeat that alarm for other days of the week so that the user doesn’t have to constantly set a reminder for the same activity. The user also gets to choose a sound the alarm will play as to their liking and has the option to snooze it. Once the alarm is set the alarm gets stored in the calendar and will go off during the set time. Indeed, setting alarms is a great way to establish the time you want to make available for your work.</p>

							<h4 class="feature-title">Calendar</h4>
							<p>Scheduling is the art of planning your activities so that you can achieve your goals and priorities in the time you have available. Indeed, once you have your alarms set they will appear in a calendar view. The best part about the calendar view is you can view your activities in a day, weekly, monthly or yearly view. Thus, if you are trying to schedule in new activities, you will be able to see what you already have planned and plan accordingly. Additionally, you are not going to want to set alarms for all the activities that you plan. Time Builder’s Task Manager feature allows the user to schedule reminders as well, but without setting the alarm. All the reminders set in Task Manager will appear in the Calendar feature as well. Lastly, goals set in Goal Keeper can be viewed on the Calendar feature as well. Everything is one place, but at the same time it is categorized so that it’s easy to understand and navigate.</p>

							<h4 class="feature-title">Task Manager</h4>	
							<p>Time Builder’s, Task Manager feature is very similar to the Alarm Feature but has more functionality. The Task Manager feature allows you to schedule reminders without having to set an alarm. These reminders are than viewable on the Calendar feature. Task manager also allows you to categorize reminders. For example, most people categorize their day by work, education and leisure. The user will have the ability to categorize reminders to their liking. In addition, the task manager allows the user to view reminders in past, present and future sections. In other words, tasks that are completed will appear in the past section. Tasks schedules for the day will appear in the present section. Lastly, tasks scheduled for later throughout the week, month or year will be in the future section. </p>

							<h4 class="feature-title">Goal Keeper</h4>
							<p>Why set goals? Indeed, setting goals gives you long-term vision and short-term motivation. It focuses your acquisition of knowledge, and helps you to organize your time so that you can make the most of it. Goal Keeper is a bit similar to Task Manager. Goal Keeper allows you to set goals for the day, week, month and year. Setting goals allows you to take control of your life and then when your goals are written down, you are more likely to achieve those goals.</p>

							<h4 class="feature-title">Time Management Charts</h4>
							<p>The use of effective time management charts can help you understand how your time is spent on the different things you do in life. You will be scheduling so many reminders for many different aspects of your life that you don’t really keep track of where you are spending the most time. A picture presentation of the task time management graph helps you better understand and see where your time goes. It can help you make use of your time better. In other words,  your Time Management Chart will help you recognize patterns in where you spend the most time and where you spend the least time. It can give you a sense of if you have a healthy work-balance status in your life.
